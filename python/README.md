# Deep Learning for Autonomous Vehicles


## Getting started

#### Venv Setup
First set up a python virtual environment:
```
$ cd <desired-dir>
$ python3 -m venv <desired venv name>
$ activate desired venv name
```
Make sure to install python 3 in case you do not have it.

#### Module Installation
Execute in this directory:
```
$ pip install -e .
$ pip install -r requirements.txt FIXME -> Write that!
``
To use deepsort, you need the deepsort repository cloned (https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid). In this folder, do ´pip install -e´ to install torchreid that is used in deepsort.
